Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix arr is shown below:

    1   2   3
    4   5   6
    9   8   9

The left-to-right diagonal = 1 + 5 + 9 = 15.
The right to left diagonal = 3 + 5 + 9 = 17.
Their absolute difference is | 15 - 17 | = 2.
